# Recipe Search

## Description
This is a recipe search site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site allows users to search for recipes by typing ingredients into a search input and clicking on the search icon. The site makes requests to the external Edamam API and displays pictures of the dishes that can be cooked with the input ingredients, along with their recipes. This project helped me practice working with API calls and grid and flexbox layout.

## Features
- Search for recipes by ingredients
- Display pictures and recipes of dishes

## Future Work
- Rebuild the site with Vue.js
- Add pagination to handle large numbers of search results
- Integrate another API for translation from other languages, which will allow users to type in different languages and get recipes in those languages as well
- Add the ability to add recipes to a favourites list
- Add filters to choose different types of recipes
